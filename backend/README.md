# Travel Wallet & Loyalty – Backend API

NestJS API for wallet, points, POS identification (NFC/QR), and redemptions.

## Setup

**Requires PostgreSQL running** (e.g. on `localhost:5432`). The API will not start until the database is reachable.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ORIGINS
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

API base: `http://localhost:3000` (set `VITE_API_URL` in the web app to match; set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in mobile for device testing).

## Endpoints

## Database

PostgreSQL. Set `DATABASE_URL`. Tables are created via TypeORM `synchronize` in development. For production, use migrations and set `synchronize: false`.

## Future: standalone agency website

The API is designed so a separate agency website can reuse the same backend: customer auth (`POST /auth/login`, `GET /customers/me`), wallet (`GET /wallet/me`), points (`GET /points/me`), catalog (`GET /hotels`, `GET /flights`), and bookings (`GET /bookings/customer/me`, `POST /bookings/from-catalog`). Use the same JWT and CORS; add the website origin to `CORS_ORIGINS`.

## Seeding first admin/agent

```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL in .env, then:
npm run seed
```

Creates admin user `admin@travel.local` / `admin123` (or `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`), a branch "Main Branch", and an agent linked to that admin so they can use POS redemptions.
